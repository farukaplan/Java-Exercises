# Sort-Algorithm-Speeds

In here, we’ll compare the relative performance of different sorting algorithms on the same dataset as well as the same algorithm on different datasets. Here are the steps:

● Implement selection sort, bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort, and counting sort.
● Generate integer arrays of size 1000, 10000, 50000, and 100000, where each element is randomly selected between 0 and 106.
● Measure the time it takes to sort the arrays using each of the sorting algorithms. Note that all sorting algorithms should use the same input when the input size is the same.
● To test the speed of your sorting algorithms, you may use System.currentTimeMillis(), which returns a long that contains the current time (in milliseconds). Call System.currentTimeMillis() before and after the algorithm runs, and subtract the two times.
● We are provide the CPU time on the same machine, and the number of comparisons for each of the sorting algorithms for each input.
