# Sort Algorithms

In here, weâ€™ll compare the relative performance of different sorting algorithms on the same dataset as well as the same algorithm on different datasets. Here are the steps:

- Implemented selection sort, bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort, and counting sort.
- Generate int arrays of size 1k, 10k, 50k, and 100k, where each element is randomly selected between 0 and 106.
- Measure the time it takes to sort the arrays using each of the sorting algorithms.
- We are provide the CPU time on the same machine, and the number of comparisons for each of the sorting algorithms for each input.
